# Hackathon2023 Access# Cleaner Community

[Housing Hub](https://housing-hub.netlify.app) The Housing Hub Web Application is a purpose-driven project that addresses the concerns and challenges faced by residents of NYCHA housing developments. Developed during the Hackathon 2023 under the theme "Access," our team of four developers worked tirelessly for 36 hours to create a fully functional platform that empowers NYCHA residents to advocate for positive change.

Utilizing a range of cutting-edge technologies, including React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we crafted an intuitive and user-friendly platform. The application enables NYCHA residents to submit and sign petitions related to various housing issues, fostering community engagement and collective action.

Our team's dedication to the project's success led us to integrate external APIs, including Email Js and Firebase. These integrations facilitate smooth communication between residents, providing real-time updates on petition progress and community responses.

With its user-friendly interface and advanced search options, the Housing Hub Web Application stands as a testament to the power of technology in driving meaningful change and empowering communities. Completed within a tight time frame of 36 hours, this project showcases our team's passion for creating impactful solutions that enhance accessibility and elevate voices for a better tomorrow.
